## 3. Stress Testing Results

### Scenario Analysis
```
Base Case:
  ECL:                $[XX,XXX,XXX]
  Monthly Profit:     $[X,XXX,XXX]

Mild Stress (+25% PD):
  ECL:                $[XX,XXX,XXX]  (+[X.X%])
  Monthly Profit:     $[X,XXX,XXX]  (-[X.X%])
  Impact:             $[XXX,XXX] additional loss provision

Severe Stress (+50% PD):
  ECL:                $[XX,XXX,XXX]  (+[X.X%])
  Monthly Profit:     $[X,XXX,XXX]  (-[X.X%])
  Impact:             $[X,XXX,XXX] additional loss provision
```

**Capital Adequacy**: Under severe stress, profit margin would decline to [X.X%], [above/below] minimum threshold of [X.X%].
